**Assignment of Object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD)** in Nackademin Java course.

The assignment was to analyze a business case, write the specification, draw a use case diagram and class diagram, and apply two design patterns. 
I used the Singleton pattern to read files and the Builder pattern. Each method returns the instance, allowing for method chaining instead of using a long constructor.
Please note that there is no user interface was used, input and output are handled through the console.

**Overview of program**
Rainbow Preschool needs an app to make it easier for teachers and parents to manage children's attendance and schedules. The app should also streamline communication between them.
Daycare System is a platform developed for Rainbow Preschool. The principal has requested an app that both teachers and parents can use. The idea is inspired by the app "Prion," which is widely used by parents today.

Teachers:

- Manage children's attendance
- Manage children's schedules (update drop-off and pick-up times)
- Add and remove children from the system
- Create and manage departments
- Move children between departments
- Send general, group-specific, and personal information to guardians

Parents:

- Manage children's schedules (update drop-off and pick-up times)
- Report absences
- View contact information for the child's department
- View information from the preschool at a general, group-specific, and personal level
